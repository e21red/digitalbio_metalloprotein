We plan to study the relationship between the metal ions in metalloproteins and dehydrons. We will perform our tests upon a selection of about twenty metalloproteins including cadherins. We will contrast our results with 

For metals in general, we will find out what it means for a metal ion to have a dehydron in its vicinity by 

1) Finding our metal ions. This can be accomplished simply by searching for specific metal atoms within a PDB file.
   We will use the metal ions {Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Cs+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+}
2) For each metal, locating all the dehydrons within some threshold distance.
3) Obtaining a distance in 3-D space between each dehydron's H-Bond and the metal ion.
4) Create a statistical representation of the resulting distances, and explain what we have found.

We can make this task simpler by using Wrappa, which will allow us to view all of the metal ions within the desolvation shell of a dehydron.

The 'desolvation shell' is the shell of hydrophobic structures that protects the hydrogen bond in a dehydron from water.

We propose to look at the locations of the metal ions in these metalloproteins with respect to their nearby dehydrons' desolvation shells. We expect to find our metal ions within the desolvation shells, for if they weren't, their ionic nature would cause them to bond ionically with the nearby waters rather than with the proteins that they are attached to.

Our early data supports this idea, with all our proteins having a ratio of metal ions : desolvation shells with metal ions >= 1.
We plan to get more precise and detailed dat in the near future, including:

1) Breaking down our data by metal and protein type, so we can observe trends in cadherins and other specific types of metalloprotein groups

2) Getting precise data on each metal's position within the desolvation shell.

3) Testing how this changes with parameters of the desolvation shell (distance, center atom, etc.)
